# Serializer

The serializer will save a Java class to a file instead of just pulling the contents and saving them as text.
Basically, it will capture the state of the class (all data within the class) and write it to a file, when it is read
back in (or deserialized) it will create a new instance of a particular class in the same state it was in when
it was serialized.

## Rules

Classes that can be serialized:

- Player

### Player

A player class **must** be saved in the following format:

- `Player_uuid`

The `uuid` must be replaced with the instance's generated UUID. These can be generated by calling the appropriate
method from a class which can be serialized.

The end product should look something like this:

- `Player_123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`
